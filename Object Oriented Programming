Here's an example taken from the Scikit-learn website:

from sklearn import svm
X = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]
y = [0, 1]
clf = svm.SVC()
clf.fit(X, y)  
How does Scikit-learn train the SVM model? You don't need to know because the implementation is hidden with object-oriented programming

procedural programming vs onject oriented programming.

Every object has characteristics and actions.

class represents an object group in python.
object is a member of a class.
method represents an action belonging to a class.
attribute is a characteristic of a class?
