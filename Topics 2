Unit testing tools
To install pytest, run pip install -U pytest in your terminal. You can see more information on getting started here.

Create a test file starting with test_.
Define unit test functions that start with test_ inside the test file.
Enter pytest into your terminal in the directory of your test file and it detects these tests for you.
test_ is the default; if you wish to change this, you can learn how in this pytest configuration.

In the test output, periods represent successful unit tests and Fs represent failed unit tests. Since all you see is which test functions failed, it's wise to have only one assert statement per test. Otherwise, you won't know exactly how many tests failed or which tests failed.

Your test won't be stopped by failed assert statements, but it will stop if you have syntax errors.
